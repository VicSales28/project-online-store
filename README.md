# Online Store 🛍️

This project was developed by the team of developers: [Victoria Sales](https://github.com/VicSales28), [Bruna Gimenez](https://github.com/brunagimenez), [Fernando Ferreira](https://github.com/z-Fernando), [Katia Yamamoto](https://github.com/katiamyamamoto), while we were studying component's lifecycle and React Router at Trybe Programming School. 

The developed application is a simplified version, without database persistence, of an online store. It allows the user to search for products, select products through categories, add products to the cart and edit products that are in the cart. 

The products and categories present in this application were obtained from the API of Mercado Livre Brasil.

* ESLint uses Espree for JavaScript parsing.
* ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code.
* ESLint is completely 'pluggable', each of the rules is a plugin and you can add […]

To run them locally, run the commands below:
`npm run lint`
`npm run lint:styles`
